# Singly linked list

A singly linked list is a data structure consisting of a sequence of elements, each of which point to the next element. The exception to this is the last element in the list, which cannot point to its next element since there is none. The name "linked list" can be confusing because there is no literal "linking" going on; the elements are not joined together in any physical way. Instead, the name "linked" refers merely to a given element's own knowledge of the address of the next element.
