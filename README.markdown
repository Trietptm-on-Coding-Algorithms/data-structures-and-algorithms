# Data Structures and Algorithms "for people without computer science degrees"

A compendium for self-education about "data structures and algorithms," created by and for "people without computer science degrees."

## Motivation

Core computer science concepts, such as "data structures and algorithms," are taught using a classist, fucked-up pedagogical approach that makes me viscerally, incoherently angry. Nevertheless, I would like to know what the fuck people mean when they say things like "data structure" or "algorithm" and refer to specific structures or specific algorithms. Despite 20 years of practical programming experience, working in a variety of Information Technology sectors, I still feel completely lost when attempting to navigate this area of specialized knowledge.

THIS IS NOT A PERSONAL FAILURE. Moreover, there are *explicit and intentional* reasons that benefit mostly white men that explain the consistency and reliability for which education around computer science fails so many people like myself.

This repository exists, therefore, as a place for me to compile my own notes about this esoteric but critically important branch of the knowledge tree. It is my hope that it becomes useful, over time, to others who are feeling similarly despondent about the over-the-top doucheyness with which "CS courses" and "techies" talk about this area of their craft.

We understand that this doucheyness is a form of power-hoarding, i.e., gatekeeping. In the spirit of the original hacker ethos, "information should be free," we recognize this social gatekeeping behavior as a form of censorship and are determined to use the Internet to route around it.

TL;DR: Fuck your CS courses and your classist academia. We're going to learn this thing without your goddamn "help."
